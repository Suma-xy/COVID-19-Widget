# Hello World xD
I am a young, IT-interested boy from Berlin, I try to find new ideas and try to implement them. In this project I focus on iOS, I try to develop new iOS-14 widgets with Javascript, I hope you like them. <br>
To use them you have to download the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Scriptable App from the App Store. </a>.
