# Hello World xD
I am a young, IT-interested boy from Berlin, I try to discover new ideas and try to implement them. In this project I focus on one platform, Apple!  I try to develop new iOS-14 and macOS Big Sur Widgets with Javascript, I hope you like them. <br>
To use them on iOS and iPadOS you have to install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Scriptable App from the App Store. </a> For macOS the Scriptable App is in beta phase, you can download it <a href="https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/">here. </a>
